# Phileas - a Python library for scientific experiment automation

phileas is a Python library that eases the acquisition of hardware security
datasets. Its goal is to ease the setup of fault injection and side-channel
analysis experiments, using simple YAML configuration files to describe both
the experiment bench and the configurations of its instruments. This provides
basic building blocks towards the repeatability of such experiments. Finally,
it provides a transparent workflow that yields datasets properly annotated to
ease the data analysis stage.
