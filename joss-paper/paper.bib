  abstract = {Data and instruction dependent power consumption can reveal cryptographic secrets by means of Side-Channel Analysis (SCA). Consequently, manufacturers and evaluation labs perform thorough testing of cryptographic implementations to confirm their security. Unfortunately, the computation and storage needs for the resulting measurement data can be substantial and at times, limit the scope of their analyses. Therefore, it is surprising that only few publications study the efficient computation and storage of side-channel analysis related data.To address this gap, we discuss high-performance design patterns and how they align with characteristics of different file formats. More specifically, we perform an in-depth analysis of common side-channel analysis algorithms and how they can be implemented for maximum performance. At the same time, we focus on storage requirements and how to reduce them, by applying compression and chunking.In addition, we investigate and benchmark popular SCA frameworks. Moreover, we propose SCARR, a proof of concept SCA framework based on the file format Zarr, that outperforms all considered frameworks in several common algorithms (SNR, TVLA, CPA, MIA) by a factor of about two compared to the thus far fastest framework for a given profile. Most notably, in all tested scenarios, we are faster even with file compression, than other frameworks without compression. We are convinced that the presented design patterns and comparative study will benefit the greater side-channel community, help practitioners to improve their own frameworks, and reduce data storage requirements, associated costs, and lower computation/energy demands of SCA, as required to perform more testing at scale.},

  abstract = {Side-channel analyses constitute a major threat for embedded devices, because they allow an attacker to recover secret keys without the device being aware of the sensitive information theft. They have been proved to be efficient in practice on many deployed cryptosystems. Even during the standardization process for the AES, many scientists have raised the attention on the potential vulnerabilities against implementation-level attacks Chari et al. (A Cautionary Note Regarding Evaluation of AES Candidates on Smart-cards, 133–147, 1999). The evaluation of devices against side-channel attacks is now common practice, especially in ITSEFs. This procedure has even been formalized recently Standaert et al. (EUROCRYPT LNCS 5479:443–461, 2009). The framework suggests to estimate the leakage via an information theoretic metric, and the performance of real attacks thanks to either the success rates or the guessing entropy metrics. The DPA contests are a series of international challenges that allow researchers to improve existing side-channel attacks or develop new ones and compare their effectiveness on several reference sets of power consumption traces using a common methodology. In this article, we focus on the second edition of this contest, which targeted a FPGA-based implementation of AES. This article has been written jointly with several of the participants who describe their tactics used in their attacks and their improvements beyond the state of the art. In particular, this feedback puts to the fore some considerations seldom described in the scientific literature, yet relevant to increase the convergence rate of attacks. These considerations concern in particular the correction of acquisition defects such as the drifting side-channel leakage, the identification of the most leaking samples, the order in which subkeys are attacked, how to exploit subkeys that are revealed easily to help retrieve subkeys that leak less, and non-linear leakage models.},

As a result, measurements of the power used by actual computers or microchips contain information about the operations being performed and the data being processed. Cryptographic designs have traditionally assumed that secrets are manipulated in environments that expose no information beyond the specified inputs and outputs. This paper examines how information leaked through power consumption and other side channels can be analyzed to extract secret keys from a wide range of devices. The attacks are practical, non-invasive, and highly effective—even against complex and noisy systems where cryptographic computations account for only a small fraction of the overall power consumption. We also introduce approaches for preventing DPA attacks and for building cryptosystems that remain secure even when implemented in hardware that leaks.},

Fault sensitivity means the critical condition when a faulty output begins to exhibit some detectable characteristics, e.g., the clock frequency when fault operation begins to occur. We explain that the fault sensitivity exhibits sensitive-data dependency and can be used to retrieve the secret key. This paper presents two practical FSA attacks against two AES hardware implementations on SASEBO-R, PPRM1-AES and WDDL-AES. Different from previous work, we show that WDDL-AES is not perfectly secure against setup-time violation attacks.},

  abstract = {In recent years, smartphones have become an increasingly important storage facility for personal sensitive data ranging from photos and credentials up to financial and medical records like credit cards and person’s diseases. Trivially, it is critical to secure this information and only provide access to the genuine and authenticated user. Smartphone vendors have already taken exceptional care to protect user data by the means of various software and hardware security features like code signing, authenticated boot chain, dedicated co-processor and integrated cryptographic engines with hardware fused keys. Despite these obstacles, adversaries have successfully broken through various software protections in the past, leaving only the hardware as the last standing barrier between the attacker and user data. In this work, we build upon existing software vulnerabilities and break through the final barrier by performing the first publicly reported physical Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attack on an iPhone in order to extract the hardware-fused devicespecific User Identifier (UID) key. This key – once at hand – allows the adversary to perform an offline brute-force attack on the user passcode employing an optimized and scalable implementation of the Key Derivation Function (KDF) on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cluster. Once the passcode is revealed, the adversary has full access to all user data stored on the device and possibly in the cloud.As the software exploit enables acquisition and processing of hundreds of millions oftraces, this work further shows that an attacker being able to query arbitrary many chosen-data encryption/decryption requests is a realistic model, even for compact systems with advanced software protections, and emphasizes the need for assessing resilience against SCA for a very high number of traces.},

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.\&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

However, it is often needed to specialize and adapt them further in order to successfully tackle some specific problem. One such example is the fault injection attack where the goal is to find a specific set of parameters that can lead to a successful cryptographic attack in a minimum amount of time. In this paper we address the process of the specialization of genetic algorithm from its standard form to the final, highly-specialized one. In this process we needed to customize crossover operator, add a mapping between the values in cryptographic domain and genetic algorithm domain and finally to adapt genetic algorithm to work on-the-fly. For the last phase of development we plan to go to the memetic algorithm by adding a local search strategy. Furthermore, we give a comparison between our algorithm and random search which is the mostly employed method for this problem at the moment. Our experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the random search.},

  abstract = {To provide insurance on the resistance of a system against side-channel analysis, several national or private schemes are today promoting an evaluation strategy, common in classical cryptography, which is focussing on the most powerful adversary who may train to learn about the dependency between the device behaviour and the sensitive data values. Several works have shown that this kind of analysis, known as Template Attacks in the side-channel domain, can be rephrased as a classical Machine Learning classification problem with learning phase. Following the current trend in the latter area, recent works have demonstrated that deep learning algorithms were very efficient to conduct security evaluations of embedded systems and had many advantage compared to the other methods. Unfortunately, their hyper-parametrization has often been kept secret by the authors who only discussed on the main design principles and on the attack efficiencies. This is clearly an important limitation of previous works since (1) the latter parametrization is known to be a challenging question in Machine Learning and (2) it does not allow for the reproducibility of the presented results. This paper aims to address theses limitations in several ways. First, completing recent works, we propose a comprehensive study of deep learning algorithms when applied in the context of side-channel analysis and we clarify the links with the classical template attacks. Secondly, we address the question of the choice of the hyper-parameters for the class of multi-layer perceptron networks and convolutional neural networks. Several benchmarks and rationales are given in the context of the analysis of a masked implementation of the AES algorithm. To enable perfect reproducibility of our tests, this work also introduces an open platform including all the sources of the target implementation together with the campaign of electro-magnetic measurements exploited in our benchmarks. This open database, named ASCAD, has been specified to serve as a common basis for further works on this subject. Our work confirms the conclusions made by Cagli et al. at CHES 2017 about the high potential of convolutional neural networks. Interestingly, it shows that the approach followed to design the algorithm VGG-16 used for image recognition seems also to be sound when it comes to fix an architecture for side-channel analysis.},

  abstract = {We describe a new class of attacks on secure microcontrollers and smartcards. Illumination of a target transistor causes it to conduct, thereby inducing a transient fault. Such attacks are practical; they do not even require expensive laser equipment. We have carried them out using a flashgun bought second-hand from a camera store for \$30 and with an \$8 laser pointer. As an illustration of the power of this attack, we developed techniques to set or reset any individual bit of SRAM in a microcontroller. Unless suitable countermeasures are taken, optical probing may also be used to induce errors in cryptographic computations or protocols, and to disrupt the processor’s control flow. It thus provides a powerful extension of existing glitching and fault analysis techniques. This vulnerability may pose a big problem for the industry, similar to those resulting from probing attacks in the mid-1990s and power analysis attacks in the late 1990s.},
